EnchantInsanityScala
====================

A complete rewrite of the Enchant Insanity mod for Minecraft.Now uses Scala Language.

Stopped Developement:

Now working on a modular set of mods that can be used as an API instead of a single mod with lots of functionality.

These include CoreMe, TrackMe, EnchantMe, ShowMe, ChangeMe, and more. I'm switching to a full TDD process using scala, I will be documenting everything
